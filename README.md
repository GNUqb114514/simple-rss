# simple-rss
An easy-to-use RSS reader.

## Why a new reader?

Let's imagine:

> You're writing a new [lemonbar](https://github.com/LemonBoy/bar) script
> to add count of unread articles in your RSS feeds...
>
> And you found that it seems like **there're NO RSS readers
> that provide this interface**...
>
> So you might need to write a lot of codes to fetch rss, hack your reader
> to get read articles, then filter them...
>
> Or **just use this project.**

As you can see, this project provides an easy-to-use interface
to make you easy to integrate to your bash script,
lemonbar script, etc.

> Note that this project is work in progress - to be honest, this projest
> is *just a new cargo project* now.
